# Platform?
The intended platform for this project is IOS, with the goal of this app being published on the IOS App Store eventually.
# Framework / Programming Language?
The programming language for this platform is Swift, given that the intended platform is IOS. 
# Cross-platform development?
I do not wish to explore cross-platform development through this project as it has a clear goal and target audience
which currently does not include Android. At some point, this app might scale to include other target audiences 
such as Android but for now there are no plans to. 
# Explanation of Selections?
The primary reasoning for designing this app for the IOS platform and using the Swift language is due to 
wanting to create an IOS app that could be published on the app store to teach users about personal finance
and investing tips. I personally am invested in the Apple ecosystem, and have previously programmed for Android 
apps and found it not as favorable as what I am hoping to accomplish with this project, as well as I do not own
any Android devices so acclimating to the UX was cumbersome and confusuing. As a developer, I have always wanted the 
chance to explore Swift and IOS so that is the reasoning behind these selections.
